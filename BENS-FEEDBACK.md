# Ben's Feedback on Dashboards

## 2026-02-22

### Home Page
- REPLACE entirely with the Focus Engine ("What Should I Be Doing Right Now?")
- Current overview page is not the final design

### Sales Pipeline
- Add a visual weekly calendar showing all events with actual event names
- Color code events: 121 (one color), Event (another), Other (third)
- One-click to change event type between 121/Event/Other
- Clicking a week's column in the scorecard chart should show that week's calendar view so Ben can correct discrepancies
- REMOVE pipeline value tracking - too much work for too little value
- REMOVE pipeline stage value tracking - same reason

### EOS Scorecard
- Real measurables (from Airtable - need API integration):
  - Days to Go-Live (target: under 60 days, 90-day rolling avg)
  - Unbranded Clicks (target: 400/mo in Q1)
  - Profit (target: $140k 2026 / $22k Q1)
  - Revenue (target: $285k 2026 / $48k Q1)
  - MRR Velocity (target: $1,250/mo)
  - MRR Stability (target: $25k 2026)
  - ACV Velocity (target: $14,375/mo)
  - Sales Cycle Length (target: under 1 month, 90-day rolling avg)
  - 121s/week (target: 6) - ADDING
  - Networking Events - ADDING
- Data source: Airtable (need to connect API)

### General
- Need clear indicators on each dashboard showing what's live data vs sample data
- All sample data should be replaced with real data ASAP
